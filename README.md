# Sample Hardhat Project

BusinessRegistry is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to streamline and decentralize the registration and approval process of business ideas. 
It ensures transparency, reduces bureaucracy, and empowers both business owners and authorized reviewers through a blockchain-based solution.

## Features

- Submit new business ideas with details like name, category, region, and description.
- Validate submitted businesses based on allowed regions.
- Admin can:
  - Approve business submissions.
  - Add or remove reviewers.
  - Set allowed or disallowed regions.
- Reviewers can:
  - Reject pending business proposals.
- Emits events for key actions (submission, approval, rejection).
- View full details of any submitted business.

## Smart Contract Overview

### Data Structures

- `Business` struct: Contains business metadata including status (`Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected`).
- `Status` enum: Represents the review state of a business.
- `allowedRegions`: Mapping to control which regions can submit businesses.
- `reviewers`: Mapping to track approved reviewer addresses.
- `businesses`: Mapping to store all submitted businesses.

### Access Control

- `onlyAdmin` modifier: Restricts access to contract owner.
- `onlyReviewer` modifier: Restricts access to approved reviewers.
